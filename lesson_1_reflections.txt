How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

You can compare just the lines that have been modified instead of searching through the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can go back to the previous workable version of the file in case you had made a mistake and do not find where is the issue.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

manually commit: pros: more logical commits, no clutterd history of the file. Cons: could commit after a big change and loss important information, forget to commit.

automatically commit: pros: no need to think about commit
cons: don't have any logic, loads of files that are fairly the same.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is more programming oriented system conversely google docs is created to manage one single file in an office alike environment.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

using git log you can scroll through the history of the commits, you can see the importance of have a good description because it is the only way to recognise every commit. With the diff command, you can see where were the changes you made between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can go back easily to a workable version of the files without missing anything so you take less risks of losing your work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use version control in a website.
