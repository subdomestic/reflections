What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Doing merges manually is not error-free. You could change the whole code trying to fix the merge problems. However, it is easier to organize the files keeping logical blocks of code.
Git's automatic merging is an easier process but the file could be clumpsy.
