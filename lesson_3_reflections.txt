When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to have a backup elsewhere or when you want to share your work with somebody else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Security purposes.
It's not necessary to pull all changes at once, saving time not doing it every single change you made in the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks clones someone else's repository in GitHub to your own account
clones copies a entire repository locally and from GitHub to your local machine
branches creates a different branch in case you want to test new features without affecting the workable version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In case you don't have Internet access and need to work you can do it offline with the latest version of the files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
without using GutHub you would have to send an email and specify the changes you've made to the files stored somewhere in the cloud. 
It wouldn't be harder but slower.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you want to work in a new feature, it's better to work in a different branch rather than work directly in the master branch.
You can test anything you want wihtout fearing to break the code alredy writen.
